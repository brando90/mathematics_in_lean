# Nov 9 2023 - lean project set up & root 2 is irrational proof mathematics in lean

Run (ref: https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html#working-on-an-existing-project) 
```bash 
# Ref: https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/C01_Introduction.html

# git clone your fork of mathematics in lean
git clone https://github.com/brando90/mathematics_in_lean.git
cd $HOME/mathematics_in_lean
# installs precompiled binaries in lead (note ran in some root folder of lean)
lake exe cache get 
# check the binaries got install (idk why its not showing in vscode)
ls -lah $HOME/mathematics_in_lean
# 
lake build
# then go to the hellow world .lean file $HOME/mathematics_in_lean/MIL/C01_Introduction/S01_Getting_Started.lean in VSCODE and observe how it prints hello world based on where the cursor is in the Lean Infoview tab on the right
```
(note: this command currently only works in projects which import mathlib4 as a dependency)
(todo: why can we only put Rudin inside MIL? How do I build a correct Lean project inside my location? Formulate question and ask it in Zulip)

## Extra

```lean
set trace.compiler.ir
-- note you can go through lot's of options for trace
```
