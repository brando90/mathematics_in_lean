open Set Filter Topology

def principal {α : Type*} (s : Set α) : Filter α
    where
  sets := { t | s ⊆ t }
  univ_sets := Set.subset_univ _
  sets_of_superset := by
    apply Set.Subset.trans
  inter_sets := Set.subset_inter

def atTopOnNat : Filter ℕ where
  sets := { s | ∃ a : ℕ, ∀ b : ℕ, a ≤ b → b ∈ s }
  univ_sets := by
    use 0
    intro b hb
    exact Set.mem_univ _
  sets_of_superset := by
    intro x y h₁ h₂
    simp at *
    rcases h₁ with ⟨a, ha⟩
    use a
    exact fun b a => h₂ (ha b a)
  inter_sets := by
    intro x y
    simp
    intro a ha b hb
    use max a b
    intro b'
    simp
    exact fun h₁ h₂ => ⟨ha _ h₁, hb _ h₂⟩
```

exercise:
- can you do all of topology using filters instead of open sets

## Tips I learned

case ?
dsimp * == sort of like beta reductions applied definitions a bunch of times

fitler in topology ~ some proposition P is eventually true.
filters try to generalize sequences or what?
