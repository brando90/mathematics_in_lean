# Nov 7 2023 - Show A = { p : Q | p^2 < 2} has no maximum element

- SD/TODO
    - do sqrt(2) proof in mathematics in lean & thus get in installation in lean figured out for me
      - https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/C02_Basics.html
    - fix my installation in my formalization of rudin lean project repo 
    - (informal) prove & clarify Thm Show A = { p : Q | p^2 < 2} has no maximum element
        - e.g., recall negations with quantifiers forall exists and exists for all in context of my proof and max element
    - (formal) formalize the prev proof
    - do the other two proofs suggested in the lean prover club

Limit of ε * (p + ε) as ε -> 0 using filters and continuity:
import Mathlib.Topology.Algebra.Monoid
import Mathlib.Data.Rat.Init

theorem tendsto (p : ℚ) : Tendsto (fun ε : ℚ => ε * (p + ε)) (𝓝 0) (𝓝 0) := by

    continuity
  simpa using this.tendsto 0

/- is not a valid command. In Slack, all messages that start with the "/" character are interpreted as commands.
If you are trying to send a message and not run a command, try preceding the "/" with an empty space.

Specs:
- use reasonable amount mathlib, so it's ok to re-use the rationls from mathlib

Proofs
0. p² = 2 has no rational solution
1. Showing A = {p ∈ ℚ | p² < 2} has no maximum element.

Thm: ∀p ∈ A, ∃ q ∈ A, p < q.
q = p + e

WTS: (p + e)² < 2
p² + 2pe + e²
p² + pe + pe + e²
intuitively want make e subject
p² + pe + e(p + e)
observe that p + e < 2 (lemma)
p² + pe + 2e < 2
p² + e(p + 2) < 2
e < 2 - p² / (p + 2)
-- plug e back into WTS to show it's true

Interesting. From the above:
Then run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/master/lean-toolchain -o lean-toolchain
in order to set your project's Lean 4 version to the one used by mathlib4.
Did any of the commands we tried do that implicitly? (edited)

when you add math to the end of your init command it does

I think brandos proof idea is actually a fine way to choose e, it’s just that theres one expression not parenthesized correctly :man-facepalming:
6:56
I for one was reading an inequality backwards

e < (2 - p²) / (p + 2)
yes you do need parenthesis there. I still think my proof is correct. I think it works even if you choose p+e < 100 . Whatever value you choose has to satisfy this p+e <sqrt(2) < 2  (does require proof but I think it can be done by contradiction) so any rational above root 2 works. I thought I choose the value large enough so that it would work. Intuitively 2 - p²  is similar to the "epsilon squared" and we just need to make sure we make the real epsilon we want sufficiently large and it's sufficiently large for this condition p+e <sqrt(2) < 2 . Let me know if that's right!

Regardless, I'd be curious to see the other two proof ppl suggested though! Sound interesting to me (edited)
