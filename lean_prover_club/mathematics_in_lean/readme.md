# Brando's Mathematics in Lean

This: https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/C02_Basics.html

plan:
    - sqrt(2) is irrational proof
    - get lean repos working and document how to do that reliably so I can do it for my rudin formalization project
    (- then keep going so to get more proficient in Lean)
