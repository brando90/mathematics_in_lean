# Cognitively-Inspired Compositional Theorem Prover: A Sketch-Based Approach in Lean for Automated Mathematics
Brando Miranda, contact email: brando9@stanford.edu

# Project Description
This project aspires to develop a Large Language Model (LLM) based theorem prover, named "SketchProver," capable of high-level reasoning through sketching, implemented in Lean using Lean Dojo. By leveraging the principles outlined in "Draft, Sketch, and Prove: Guiding Formal Theorem Provers with Informal Proofs," we aim to benchmark our prover against MiniF2F in Lean and enhance its capabilities through autoformalization, enabling the extraction of formal theorems from natural language sources such as mathematics textbooks. The endeavor will involve both informal and formal proofs and will explore advanced pruning techniques and data alignment metrics to refine the extracted data quality. The ultimate vision is to construct an automated mathematician with the prowess to revolutionize mathematics, scientific discovery, and AI safety, driven by the conviction that formal mathematics is pivotal for ensuring the unequivocal safety of AGI, as it can provide the irrefutable guarantees that empirical methods cannot.

# Recommended Background
Interested candidates are encouraged to share their background when reaching out. A robust foundation in Python is crucial, and proficiency in theorem proving using Lean, Coq, or Isabelle is advantageous but not obligatory
